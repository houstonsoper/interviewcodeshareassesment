# Synectics Solutions - Interview Code Share Assessment

This solution is a base for material that is used in a 1st stage interview for a Software Developer role at Synectics Solutions Ltd.

## How to prepare

During the interview, the candidate will be expected to share their screen with this solution open and talk the interviewer through some coding problems and solutions in C#. 

This can be in an IDE of the candidateâ€™s choice, but it must support .NET 6 & the running of NUnit tests (i.e., Visual Studio Community Edition)

The solution is a simple Console Application, written in .NET 6 & a supplementary NUnit test project.

## Introduction Question

We have given you this question ahead of time to help prepare for the interview and ensure you can run the tests successfully. Feel free to practice this question ahead of time, but the candidate will be expected to fully explain their solution in the interview. 

In the test project, within ToDoListTests there is a test called AddingDuplicateItemThrows, which currently fails. Write the logic in ToDoList to enable the test to pass.

## Further tasks

The interviewer will ask the candidate some further questions in the interview to gauge their experience and understanding. These questions are not aimed to catch anyone out, they will be targeted towards allowing the candidate to demonstrate their skills and can form part of an open discussion around how the application should function.
